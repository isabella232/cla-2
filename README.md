# Vercel Inc. Contributor License Agreements

## What's this?

Vercel Inc. requires that all contributors of ideas, code, or documentation to Vercel complete, sign, and submit via email an Individual Contributor License Agreement.

Our agreement reproduces without alteration the Apache Software Foundation Individual Contributor License agreement for changing appropriate references.

The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to Vercel and thereby allow us to defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future time. A signed CLA is required to be on file before contributions can be accepted.

The Individual CLA is not tied to any employer you may have, so it is recommended to use one's personal email address in the contact details, rather than an @work address. Your Full name will be public. The email address and other contact details are not published.

A Corporate CLA will be made available at a later time.

## How to submit

1. Download the [Vercel Inc - Individual CLA.pdf](/Vercel%20Inc%20-%20Individual%20CLA.pdf) file
2. Fill in your information and sign it (you can do that digitally)
3. Email it to cla@vercel.com
4. That's it! Once we get it and review it, we'll add you to the [contributors list](contributors.json) and have our CLA bot approve your PR

If you have any further questions, feel free to drop us a note on cla@vercel.com
